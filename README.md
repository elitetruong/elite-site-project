==================

Working on a business card site with Jason, Stacey and Chao.

This is my first project: I am putting together a miniature business card website, hosted on elitetruong.com.
I'm a support manager at Vox Media, food culture writer at WNYC's The Sporkful, and helper at 826NYC.
In my free time, I'm learning HTML and CSS, biking and baking pastries in Brooklyn, NY.
